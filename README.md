## Jupyter Notebook 

Since we’ll be working with Python interactively, using the [Jupyter Notebook]() is the best way to get the most out of this course. Following [this](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) installation guide, once you have your notebook up and running, go ahead and download all the data for this post here. Make sure you have the data in the same directory as your notebook and then we’re good to go!
