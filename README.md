## Byte Academy Tools

You should have received an email invitation from one of our staff members inviting you to join Byte Academy's Slack Community for registered students. Once you've set up an account, you can download the mobile app or desktop app. If you prefer to stay in-browser, you can find the slack link [here](byteacademy.slack.com).

The website you're currently on is called GitHub. As part of this course and any technology oriented position, you'll likely use GitHub for version control, meaning keeping track of the changes you make as you're writing software. To get ready for the course, please make an account [here](https://github.com/join). 

Now that you have a GitHub account, you can easily register for our online, interactive website, [ByteDev](http://bytedev.co/). Through ByteDev, you'll be able to access our free courses, as well as the ones you have registered for. 

## Operating System

[Linux]()

If you'll be working on a Mac computer, Vim is actually installed on your computer, so you can go ahead and skip this installation. For everyone else, please install vim [here](). 

Remember GitHub earlier? To use it on your actual computer, you'll need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). 


## Python & Pip 

At Byte Academy, we typically work in Python 3.6. If you haven't already, download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). 


## R Programming

As part of the data science course, we'll be using R Programming for analysis and visualization. Please download [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).


## Jupyter Notebook 

Since we’ll be working with Python interactively, using the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) is the best way to get the most out of this course. Following [this](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) installation guide, once you have your notebook up and running, go ahead and download all the data for this post here. Make sure you have the data in the same directory as your notebook and then we’re good to go! 

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, I’ve provided a brief review of which functions will be particularly useful to move along with this tutorial. 

In the image below, you’ll see three buttons labeled 1-3 that will be important for you to get a grasp of -- the save button (1), add cell button (2), and run cell button (3).

The first button is the button you’ll use to save your work as you go along (1). Feel free to choose when to save your work.

Next, we have the “add cell” button (2). Cells are blocks of code that you can run together. These are the building blocks of jupyter notebook because it provides the option of running code incrementally without having to to run all your code at once.  Throughout this tutorial, you’ll see lines of code blocked off -- each one should correspond to a cell. 

Lastly, there’s the “run cell” button (3). Jupyter Notebook doesn’t automatically run it your code for you; you have to tell it when by clicking this button. As with add button, once you’ve written each block of code in this tutorial onto your cell, you should then run it to see the output (if any). If any output is expected, note that it will also be shown in this tutorial so you know what to expect. *Make sure to run your code as you go along because many blocks of code in this tutorial rely on previous cells.*
